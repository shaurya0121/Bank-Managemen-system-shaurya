BankMan (Bank Management System) can be used by Bank Employees and/or Customers
depending on bank policy. It can be used by several employees of the bank at the same time with
required rights. It can be accessed using any general web browser with graphical interface .
Our Product consists mainly of two parts i.e. the Employee Work-Space (EWS) and the ATMBanking.
The EWS would deal with the internal banking functions like new account registration,
withdrawal, deposit, money transfer etc. The ATM banking would be for direct access of
customers, who could use it for Cash-Withdrawal, Transfers and Account-Summary.
Both of them connect to a main database server for storing and retrieving the data of the
customers.
